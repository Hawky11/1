## Latest build result — successful

The user supplied Build.log dated 2026-11-08 16:32:02. VS 2026 18.9.1 / MSVC 14.51.36231 x86 compiled all eight C++ translation units and linked `build\\dinput8.dll`, size **198,144 bytes**. One non-fatal C4754 warning remains in `AICommandSiteTrace.cpp` lines 782–785. Build.log was pasted in chat, not uploaded in the branch tree.

## Stage17 runtime result — caller attribution confirmed for this run

Runtime run: 2026-11-08, initialization at 16:34:05, relevant events 16:34:29–16:34:44.

- Stage17 r2 marker, worker entry, and INI settings are present.
- The passive observer installed successfully at callsite RVA `0x000C6502`, return RVA `0x000C6507`, original helper RVA `0x0000FAA0`; `suspended=34`.
- `ArcanaAI_Bit113SetterTrace.log` contains nine `BIT113_SET_CALL` records; every record uses `index=0x00000071`, the exact call/return RVAs, and the correct P1/P2 pointer.
- Stage16 PlayerBit17WriteTrace contains 20,456 records and eight actual bit17 transitions (four sets and four clears). There are 62 thread-watchpoint installations across 10 batches, with no warning/error/drop/skip lines.
- All four Stage16 0→1 writes at RVA `0x0000FAD2` have a preceding Stage17 call from `0x000C6502` with the same player pointer and bit index. QPC deltas are 367, 520, 396, and 353 ticks. The four corresponding clears again execute `0x000ED19F` (post-EIP `0x000ED1A9`).
- Five additional Stage17 calls occurred while the bit was already set; they did not create extra transitions.
- Four Stage15 F6A68 events all saw bit17=1 and the original JZ was not taken. No F6A9D/F6AAC/F6AD7 call was recorded; QueueTrace and EventDispatchTrace contain no type-1 / payload-`0x1E` insertion/dispatch in this run. This is a suppression-side sample, not a successful queue insertion sample.
- No warning/error/drop reports were found in the reviewed Stage17, Stage16, producer, queue, dispatch, or alternate-callsite logs.

**Conclusion:** the candidate direct caller at `AALib.exe+0xC6502` is runtime-confirmed as the origin of all four bit17 set transitions observed in this run. This does not prove it is the only possible setter path for every game state. Preserve the current evidence branch unchanged.

## Stage18 runtime result — complete for the tested scenario

- Latest runtime evidence branch: [stage18-bit113-gate-runtime-evidence](https://github.com/Hawky11/1/tree/stage18-bit113-gate-runtime-evidence), HEAD 0139152b9eeb778a23ec4f3197c57faff749a78a. This branch combines the user's 2026-11-08 18:00 uploaded runtime logs with the Stage18 overlay and Stage18_Overlay/STAGE18_RUNTIME_ANALYSIS.md.
- Source snapshot branch: [stage18-bit113-gate-condition-trace](https://github.com/Hawky11/1/tree/stage18-bit113-gate-condition-trace), HEAD 520eec4cd216795e8ffbaa8738b3602b5e40d39a. Keep it as the source-stage snapshot.
- Runtime start: 18:00:15. Stage18 marker/config and installation at RVA 0xC64A5 are present; Stage17 installation at RVA 0xC6502 is also confirmed. Both hooks report 44 suspended threads.
- **Build.log was not uploaded.** Runtime markers and installation messages prove the loaded DLL ran both hooks, but compiler/linker diagnostics and final DLL size are unavailable.

### Confirmed Stage18 findings

- Six Stage18 gate records; all returned AL=1 and the safely-read post-return byte was 0xFA. The unique state/table cases were P1 index 0x0E / selector 0x0A, P2 index 0x19 / selector 0x17, and P1 index 0x18 / selector 0x0A. No AL=0 sample was captured.
- Stage17 recorded six calls from 0xC6502, all passing bit index 0x71. Stage16 recorded 15,094 write records and three 0→1 bit17 transitions plus three clears.
- Each episode has two calls into caller function 0x4C63B0. One arrives directly from 0x4967FC (return 0x496801); the other is reached via indirect CALL EDX at 0x4CB9F8 (return 0x4CB9FA). Static table entry 0xA at 0x428AF18 points to 0x4C63B0, explaining the second invocation through callback/function-table dispatch.
- The first setter call in each episode sets bit17; the second repeats the OR when it is already set. QPC deltas are in PROJECT_HISTORY.md and STAGE18_RUNTIME_ANALYSIS.md.
- Three target Stage15 attempts had EDI=0x1E, bit17=1, ZF=1 and branchTaken=0. No F6A9D/F6AAC or F6AD7 invocation followed. QueueTrace/EventDispatchTrace/FinalCommandTrace each show 27 type-1 records for other payloads and none for 0x1E.

## Stage19 runtime result — mapping confirmed (2026-11-08)

Evidence branch: [stage19-bit113-state-map-runtime-evidence](https://github.com/Hawky11/1/tree/stage19-bit113-state-map-runtime-evidence), HEAD `3e75c07c7bdbd0827112f6a488936587a41a1b4b`. Source branch remains [stage19-bit113-state-map-trace](https://github.com/Hawky11/1/tree/stage19-bit113-state-map-trace), HEAD `841142895a976419a9bda197be286e7434993067`. The uploaded logs were placed in root `main`; the evidence branch preserves them with the exact Stage19 overlay and `Stage19_Overlay/STAGE19_RUNTIME_ANALYSIS.md`.

### Installation and limitations

- Run initialized 2026-11-08 at 19:05:37.
- Stage17 hook at RVA `0x000C6502`, Stage18 hook at RVA `0x000C64A5`, and Stage19 hook at RVA `0x000F6C08) all installed successfully; each reported 44 suspended threads.
- Stage19 marker/config show `STAGE19_BIT113_STATE_MAP_BUILD=2026-11-08-r1` and `EnableStage19StateMapTrace=1`.
- **Build.log was not uploaded.** Runtime proves a DLL containing the Stage19 instrumentation loaded and its hook installed, but compiler/linker output and final DLL size are unavailable.

### Confirmed Stage19 mapping results

There are 1,235 `STATE_MAP_CALL` records, all with `readMask=0x0F`, and no Stage19 drop/warning/error.

| Side | Raw code | Helper EAX | WORD flags | Derived state index | Calls |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| P1 | `0x20` | 0 | `0x0400` | `0x18` | 200 |
| P1 | `0x22` | 0 | `0x0400` | `0x18` | 190 |
| P1 | `0x24` | 0 | `0x0400` | `0x18` | 130 |
| P1 | `0x29` | 0 | `0x0400` | `0x18` | 12 |
| P1 | `0x4A` | 3 | `0x2000` | `0x1B` | 152 |
| P2 | `0x58` | 1 | `0x0802` | `0x19` | 82 |
| P2 | `0x59` | 1 | `0x0982` | `0x19` | 297 |
| P2 | `0x5C` | 1 | `0x0802` | `0x19` | 56 |
| P2 | `0x5E` | 3 | `0x2002` | `0x1B` | 116 |

Helper EAX totals: 532×0, 435×1, 268×3. The observed WORD flags agree with the helper priority checks. QPC correlation with Stage18 confirms raw `0x59→EAX 1→index 0x19`, raw `0x22→0→0x18`, and raw `0x20→0→0x18` in the matching gate calls. Indexes generated by raw codes `0x4A` and `0x5E` did not appear in Stage18's bit-113 gate records in this run; do not assume every map-helper call proceeds through that caller.

### Stage18 / Stage17 / Stage16 / Stage15 correlation

- Stage18 logged 42 gate results: all `AL=1`, all post-return table-byte readbacks `0xFA`. No `AL=0) sample.
- Parent-return attribution: 38 direct-call path entries (`0x00DB6801`) and four callback path entries (`0x00DEB9FA`).
- Stage17 logged eight bit-113 setter calls (two per episode).
- Stage16 logged 17,361 writes, including exactly four bit17 `0→1` writes at RVA `0x0000FAD2) and four clears at RVA `0x000ED1A9).
- Stage15 captured four payload-`0x1E` attempts. Every `F6A68` saw bit17=1 and `branchTaken=0`; no `F6A9D`, `F6AAC), or `F6AD7` invocation followed. QueueTrace, EventDispatchTrace and FinalCommandTrace contain no payload-`0x1E) insertion/dispatch.
- Most important new observation: 31 P2 gate calls at state index `0x19) returned `AL=1) but were not followed by setter calls. Therefore the table gate is not sufficient to guarantee the setter is reached.

No warning/error/drop was found in the reviewed Stage19, Stage18, Stage17, Stage16, Stage15, Queue, Dispatch, FinalCommand or AlternateCall logs.

## Current task — runtime-test Stage20

Source branch: [stage20-bit113-object-bit2-guard-trace](https://github.com/Hawky11/1/tree/stage20-bit113-object-bit2-guard-trace), HEAD `11dde281a08a3481517d0cb60d4752393fa0e578`. It is based on the immutable Stage19 source snapshot, not the Stage19 runtime-evidence branch.

### Build result — successful

The user supplied the complete build transcript in chat:
- Started 2026-11-08 19:55:42,91.
- Visual Studio 18 Community; MSVC 14.51.36231; Win32/x86.
- All eight C++ translation units compiled, including AITrace.cpp.
- Link succeeded: build\\dinput8.dll.
- DLL size: **216,576 bytes**.
- One non-fatal C4754 warning remains in AICommandSiteTrace.cpp lines 782–785. This warning is in the existing command-site arithmetic comparison and did not prevent linking.
- The Build.log was pasted in chat and has not been uploaded as a repository file.

The build result is recorded in the [Stage20 README](https://github.com/Hawky11/1/blob/stage20-bit113-object-bit2-guard-trace/Stage20_Overlay/README_STAGE20.md). Status: **build-verified, runtime-pending**.

### Stage20 runtime objective

Stage20 wraps the original five-byte CALL at RVA 0x000C64F1 to helper 0x00495B00. With argument 2, this helper tests bit 0x4 in [object+0x3B70]; AL=1 causes the original JNE at 0x000C64F8 to skip the bit-113 setter at 0x000C6502.

The wrapper records actual AL/EAX, the original ECX object pointer, the EBX slot pointer and [EBX], [object+0x3B70], bit-2 state, player fields, parent return and QPC. It calls the original helper with the duplicated original argument, preserves helper return registers/EFLAGS, discards saved ECX with flag-neutral LEA, and returns through the original call stack cleanup. Original TEST/JNE remain untouched; no new DR0–DR3 watchpoints are used.

### Next actions

1. Back up the current working DLL and install the newly built 216,576-byte DLL.
2. Before gameplay, inspect ArcanaAI_Bit113ObjectGuardTrace.log. Confirm the Stage20 build marker, EnableStage20Bit113ObjectGuardTrace=1, and successful wrapper installation at RVA 0x000C64F1 with original helper RVA 0x00095B00. If validation/installation failed, stop before gameplay and inspect the Stage20-specific error.
3. Once installation is confirmed, run a short natural COM-vs-COM test. Do not force-edit the object fields or player state.
4. Upload ArcanaAI_Bit113ObjectGuardTrace.log, ArcanaAI_Bit113GateTrace.log, ArcanaAI_Bit113SetterTrace.log, ArcanaAI_StateMapTrace.log, ArcanaAI_PlayerBit17WriteTrace.log, ArcanaAI_ProducerCallTrace.log, ArcanaAI_QueueTrace.log, ArcanaAI_EventDispatchTrace.log, ArcanaAI_FinalCommandTrace.log, and ArcanaAI_AlternateCallTrace.log where available.
5. Correlate Stage20 results to Stage18/19 by player pointer and QPC. Test whether the 31 P2 state-index-0x19 gate-only cases show guard AL=1 and bit 2 set, and whether the four known setter episodes show AL=0 and bit 2 clear.
6. Continue seeking a natural Stage18 AL=0 result on a valid 0xFF table cell; Stage20 does not observe calls rejected by the earlier table gate.

Preserve the Stage19 source/evidence branches and all Stage12–Stage19 historical branches unchanged.

## Historical branch rules

- Do not rewrite Stage12–Stage16 evidence branches.
- Keep `stage17-bit113-setter-caller-trace` and `stage17-bit113-setter-callsite-trace` distinct; they use different Stage17 hook placements.
- Append each completed analysis to `PROJECT_HISTORY.md`, update this handoff, and keep `README.md` as the entry point.
- Distinguish successful compilation from hook installation; only runtime log evidence proves the latter.
